=======
JiSuXun(www.jisuxun.com) is a web site aimed at helping people 
publish either losing or picking up a card, such as ID card or 
credit card. Such cards mean a lot to those who lost them, but 
not to those who picked up them. 
We set up this project to offer people an online place and way
to come and publish a message to look for either lost cards or
people who lost cards. 
We hope any card lost will be found and returned in honor.
